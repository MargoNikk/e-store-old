# E-store (old)

[ This is a copy of the E-store project. The difference between them is that the redux toolkit is not used here, instead of functional components, class components with the compose function are used. A classic actions creators, immutable reducers were used. ]

This is a learning project. It is an imitation of an online store with a product listing and a cart page.

What was used: HOC, Redux, Thunk, React lazy, React Router, React Hooks, Error boundry.
Bootstrap was used for styling.
